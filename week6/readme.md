# Entity Resolution (or Record Linkage or Deduplication)

This week we are going to work on entity resolution. There are plenty of different names for this topic, I would highly recommend
you to take a look at the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) page. We will start by working with 
[dedupe.io](https://dedupe.io), a powerful tool that helps to find similar rows in a dataset. Then, we will try to deduplicate datasets using the Python 
[recordlinkage](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package.
